This error occurs when you are using a library or component that expects a specific prop type and you are providing a value of an incorrect type.  For example, if a component expects a number for a `size` prop and you provide a string, you may encounter an error related to type mismatch or unexpected behavior. This is particularly common in React Native applications because of the use of native components and third-party libraries. Sometimes the error message isn't directly clear about the type issue.

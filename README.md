This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving type mismatches in component props. The `UnexpectedPropTypeError.js` file shows the buggy code, while `UnexpectedPropTypeErrorSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises from passing an incorrect data type to a component prop, leading to unexpected behavior or app crashes. The solution involves careful type checking and ensuring the correct data type is passed to the component.
